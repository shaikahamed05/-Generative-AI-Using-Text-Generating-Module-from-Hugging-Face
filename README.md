# -Generative-AI-Using-Text-Generating-Module-from-Hugging-Face

Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language.
Hugging Face Transformers: For leveraging pre-trained text generation models.
Pyngrok: To expose the local Flask application to the web.
Flask: Web framework for serving the application.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end user interface.
Key Features:
Text Generation:

Users can input prompts to generate text using Hugging Face's pre-trained models.
Real-time text generation based on user inputs.
User Interface:

A simple and intuitive interface where users can enter prompts and view generated text.
Dynamic updating of the interface to display generated text.
Local Web Server Exposure:

Use of Pyngrok to make the local Flask server accessible over the internet.
Provides a public URL for easy access and sharing.
How It Works:
Backend Development:

Flask handles routing, user inputs, and communication with the Hugging Face API.
Python scripts interact with the Hugging Face model to generate text based on user prompts.
Text Generation:

Users input text prompts through the web interface.
Flask processes the inputs and sends them to the Hugging Face API.
The API returns generated text, which is then displayed to the user.
Exposing the Local Server:

Pyngrok creates a secure tunnel to the local Flask server.
Provides a public URL, allowing remote users to access the application.
Front-end Development:

HTML/CSS for structuring and styling the web interface.
JavaScript for handling user inputs and dynamically updating the displayed text.
